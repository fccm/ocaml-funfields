=== How to compile and install ===

1) to compile the sources to bytecode:
$ make lib

2) to compile the sources to native code:
$ make opt

3) install using findlib (requires that you already installed it):
$ make findinstall

4) to generate the api documentation in the HTML format:
$ make doc

5) to test using bits.cma already compiled in the 'src' directory:
$ make test LIB_DIR=../src
